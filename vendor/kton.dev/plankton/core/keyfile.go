// WriteKeyFile creates path holding exactly content, and REFUSES to overwrite an identity.
//
// `os.WriteFile(path, seed, 0600)` looks safe and is not, in two ways that both cost a key:
//
//   - The mode applies only when the call CREATES the file. An existing world-readable
//     `alice.key` keeps its 0644 and receives the new private seed. O_EXCL removes the case:
//     the file is always new, so the mode is the one this call ASKED for - which is not the
//     same as the mode it GOT. Windows maps a Go FileMode to little more than a read-only
//     attribute, so a 0600 request lands as 0666 and the protection this function documents
//     does not exist there. The mode is therefore VERIFIED after the write, not assumed, and a
//     shortfall is reported to the caller (KeyWrite.ModeUnenforced) rather than left for the
//     operator to discover from a file listing.
//   - `keygen alice` twice used to succeed twice. The old private seed is gone, and if the .pub
//     was the only retained copy of the public half, records signed with the old key can no
//     longer be checked against that filename. The signatures stay cryptographically valid;
//     what is destroyed is the ability to check them.
//
// Three cases, in order:
//
//	identical content already there -> nothing to do. A deterministic `--seed` re-run is therefore
//	                                   idempotent, which is what a reproducible snapshot needs.
//	anything else already there     -> refuse, naming how to replace it on purpose. With force,
//	                                   the existing file is RENAMED to path+".old", never deleted:
//	                                   this function does not destroy key material, ever.
//	nothing there                   -> O_EXCL create at the requested mode.
//
// A failed write removes the partial file rather than leaving a truncated seed behind.
//
// The returned KeyWrite says what this call DID, which a caller needs in order to roll back safely:
// without it a caller cannot tell "I created this file" from "it was already here holding exactly
// this key", and undoing the second case destroys key material this call never wrote.
