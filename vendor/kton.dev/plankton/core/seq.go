// EnvelopeKey is what a FEDERATION POSITION is issued against: the stored bytes, not the record's
// identity.
//
// A record's identity covers its payload, so two stored envelopes can share it - a co-signature is
// the same claim with a signature added. Keying a position by identity gave both one number, so the
// co-signature had no position of its own and no cursor could deliver it. Keying by the
// envelope makes "a new stored thing" and "a new position" the same event, and a re-mirror of
// identical bytes idempotent for free.
//
// The hash is only a MAP KEY and never becomes the number - that always comes from the durable
// counter, so nothing an author can influence affects the ordering (SPEC §12).
//
// The two kernels then differ, and correctly so. A subnekton is an append-only log because in nekton
// ORDER CARRIES MEANING (prev, head, seal): the old line stays, keeps its position, and the
// co-signature gets a new one at the end. A plankton store holds one file per record and fotons are
// an unordered set of content-addressed facts: there is no order to preserve, so the record simply
// takes the new position. Same rule, different stores.

// SeqMap is a store's LOCAL federation numbering: record id -> the position a peer's cursor
// compares against (SPEC §12, `sync(since)`).
//
// It is stored BESIDE the records - in the registry root, next to peers.json - and never inside
// them. Two reasons, and both are load-bearing:
//
//   - A record's on-disk bytes stay identical on every peer, which is what makes a git merge of two
//     registries conflict-free. Numbering a record in place would make the same logical record
//     differ per store and turn every merge into a conflict.
//   - The number IS local. Two stores that hold the same records in a different order legitimately
//     number them differently; a cursor is only ever meaningful against the store that issued it.
//
// The invariant the numbering must hold is narrow but absolute: ONCE ISSUED, A POSITION NEVER
// CHANGES, and a newly-seen record always sorts above every position already issued. Before this
// existed, a record's position was its rank in the hash-sorted store, so planting a record whose
// hash sorts EARLY shifted every later record's position down by one - and a record a peer had
// already seen fell back to or below the cursor that peer had stored, never to be delivered again.
// Two hash attempts were enough to hide a record from a peer permanently.

	// and receive nothing, forever.
	//
	// A cursor is only meaningful against the numbering that issued it, so the answer carries the
	// epoch and a peer whose stored epoch differs MUST discard its cursor and resync from zero. That
	// is the only thing that turns a silent stall into a loud one. Nothing in the wire form used to
